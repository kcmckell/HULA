# Hawaii Ultimate Web Site

You've found the Github repository of the Hawaii Ultimate League Association's web site.  Here you'll find a public copy of our home page free to fork, copy, edit (and hopefully contribute back).

## Project structure

The *development* copy of the website lives here on Github.  The live *production* version lives on the HULA server and is connected to a branch of the development copy on my machine.
Anything contributed to the development copy is safe from being pushed to the live server until it has been thoroughly tested.

## How to contribute

### Fork

Fork this repository and clone a copy to your local machine.

### Edit

Edit your local copy.  Ideally, you'll have an (X)AMP environment ready on your machine (where X stands for W[indows], M[ac], or [L]inux).
If you would like a copy of the latest development database, email @kcmckell for a copy.

### Ask to be included
When you're ready to share with the class, issue a *pull request*.  I'll take a peek, make sure everything checks out, and then fold your contributions into the main project.
