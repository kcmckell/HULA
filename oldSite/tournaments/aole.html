<b>Tournament Party;</b> at Suicides Beach Park (Diamond Head) Saturday 11th begining at 7:30 PM
<br>
<br>

<b>FORMAT:</b><br>
The basic format will be 4 men and 3 women on the field<br>
at all times unless the captains of a particular game<br>
seem fit otherwise for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
 
We will figure out the pool play format and game times as<br>
we get closer to the actual date and compile team numbers.<br>
<br>
We do have the fields from 8a.m. until 7p.m.- games won't be<br>
too early, 11ish sounds about right.<br>
<br>
Saturday night there will be a party in which the <b>"SLOUP"</b><br>
will be resurrected. i think it is currently in a dormant<br>
larval stage(aka a new one might be under construction-michael?)<br>
live acoustic jam sesshhh by the boys from the "biker pad" and<br>
anyone else who brings an instrument.party venue still up for<br>
grabs- does anyone have a house they want to rage at? a nice<br>
intimate setting where people can get naked and bounce off the<br>
walls.safety gaugles and helmet required.<br>
<br>
If anyone is interested in spearheading a team, rush it. neighbor<br>
island is a great source to tap into for players as well as wed<br>
& fri ala moana pick-up(aka the meat market)<br>
