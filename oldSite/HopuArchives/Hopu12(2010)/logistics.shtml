<p>
<b>Camping?</b>
<ul>
<li>We have Sherwoods (aka Waimanalo Bay Beach Park) right across the street!
<li>We also have Bellows which is a next door to Sherwoods (walk to Sherwoods and then hook a left on the beach), which require parking permits if you're driving.  If you need a car permit please see your captain. Bellows is a military site so be on good behavior. We have Bellows permits until Monday morning at 8am. If you camp at Bellows, all you have to do is roll out of your tent, roll up your tent and roll down the beach to the hat draw (make sure your cars are out of there in the am, maybe park at the fields Sunday night).
<li>No camping at the fields.
 
<li>Again:
<br>	-<strong>Sherwoods</strong> camping Friday, Saturday and Sunday
<br>	-<strong>Bellows</strong> camping Friday, Saturday and Sunday be out by 8am Monday
<br>	-You can park your cars at the fields if you are staying for Monday beach day
<br>	-<strong>Fields camping</strong> at the fields is limited to Hopu commitee and VIP's (permission given by volunteer coordinator for breakfast duty and a few other choice jobs). ALL OTHERS WILL BE KICKED OUT OR CHARGED $$$ (this is a Polo Field rule not Hopu's, I would appreciate compliance with this rule)
</ul>

<h3>Travel Details </h3>

<p>
Rental cars are available at the airport. 

<p>
If you prefer not to camp, rental options are available, but you are on your own to secure them. Search near/under 'Waimanalo'. Honolulu is a 45 minute drive. 

<p>
If you need assistance with housing before or after the tournament, please contact us and we will try to find floor space, yard space, or direct you to great camping. 

<p>
<B>How do I get there?</B>
<ul>
<li>By Plane:  Fly into Honolulu International Airport (HNL). Just about every major airline serves HNL. 
<li>By Car: From the airport, Waikiki, or anywhere in Honolulu-get on H1 East. Take it until it ends! H1 turns into Kalanianaole Highway, which passes by Hawaii Kai, Hanauma Bay, Sandy Beach, Sea Life Park, and through Waimanalo. When you see the McDonald's on your right, in Waimanalo, you've got less than a half-mile to go. The fields will be on your left; camping is at Waimanalo Bay Beach Park, on your right.
<li>By Bus: From the airport-get on bus 19 or 20 heading towards Waikiki Beach. Get off at Hotel and Alakea. Cross Hotel Street, walk up Alakea a few meters (by the District Court House) and transfer to bus 57 heading towards Kailua/Sea Life Park. The bus ride is 30 minutes to an hour after you transfer, so be patient! Get off at the bus stop right outside of the Waimanalo Polo Fields/ Waimanalo Beach Recreation Area. Officially, no luggage is allowed on the bus, so pack light! From Waikiki-catch bus 58 heading towards Hawaii Kai/Sea Life Park from any of a number of bus stops on Kuhio Avenue. After a long (45 min or so) ride, get off in Waimanalo at the bus stop right outside of the Waimanalo Polo Fields/ Waimanalo Beach Recreation Area. Bus rides are $2 one way.
