		<ul>
		  <li>Player fee is $140.00 per player* this year. Fee includes all breakfasts and dinners, entertainment, camping, players' pack (cup, disc, and 
          Kaimana logo surprise), plus all field supplies (water, fruit, juice, EMT).
          <li>If possible, all players should register through the online registration system, which will be up and running 
          once team bids are accepted (November).  If you cannot register online, please do so by sending a check to: Marci Reeves, 2004 Leiloke Drive, Honolulu HI 96822.  Along with your check, include your team name, meal preference, and t-shirt size.
          <li>After January 15, 2011, late registration fee is $165 (you must have registered and PAID before January 15 in order to avoid the late fee).  Only players registering before January 15 are guaranteed a complete players' pack.  (Aloha Spirit players are not subject to the late registration fee)
          <li>A full player's fee refund is available to players who notify the tournament director (via writing or email) before January 25th, 2011 that they will not be attending the tournament. After January 25th, players withdrawing from the tournament will receive a partial refund.
          <li>Guest fee is $80. Guests may register online or by sending a check payable to Kaimana Klassik to Marci Reeves, 2004 Leiloke Drive, Honolulu HI 96822. The guest fee covers all breakfasts and dinners, entertainment, camping, and a guest pack. </li>

		<p><strong>TEAM BID REGISTRATION</strong><br>
		Caveats of the bidding process:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The $420 initial deposit can later be applied to three individual player's fees (the captain plus two other players). For those teams that do not make the final cut, we will refund your full deposit no later than December 15, 2010.
          <li>Bid-winning teams will be notified via email (as will wait-listed teams) by November 25, 2010. Bid-winning teams must respond via e-mail or letter 
          by December 1, whether or not they wish to accept the bid. If no response is received, that team will forfeit its bid, and the next wait-listed team will be contacted. At this point, the declining bid-winning team will receive a 100% refund on its deposit.
          <li>Bid-winning teams are required to secure their bid by submitting entrance fees for at least 8 players (at $140 per player) by December 15, 2010 (postmark date).
          <li>If a bid-winning and bid-accepting team fails to submit the above mentioned players' fees, its bid will be lost, and the next wait-listed team will be given priority. If we are able to fill this new vacancy, we will issue only a partial deposit refund of $160. If we are unable to fill the vacancy, no refund of deposit will be issued.
          <li>The remainders of each team's entrance fees are due by January 15, 2011. Any entrance fee postmarked after this date will be assessed the late registration fee of $165.
          <li>If any team forfeits its position after January 1, 2011, the deposit will be forfeited, regardless of our success in filling the vacancy.          <li><em>*Kaimana fees are based on an ideal budget divided by a realistic average of the number of players who have attended the tournament in recent years. Any excess monies earned by the tournament go towards supporting the events, activities, and outreach of the Hawaii Ultimate League Association (HULA). </em></li>
