<b>Years Played:</b> 1981-1991<br>
<br>
<b>Bio:</b>I was there in the beginning years of HULA (before it was even called HULA!). It started out as a little fun thing we did a couple of times a week, and then we started to become more organized. I played in the beginning Kaimana years as well. <br>

<br>I was team captain quite a few times through the years, but my original contribution was keeping team stats. I had it broken down by each team and player with categories like Baps, hairy-zontals, goals, assists, etc. It has come along way over the years. I blew out my knee in 1991 riding my dirt bike in Mililani, so that pretty much ended my Ultimate career. My son Joshua James Kekoa is a result of my Frisbee career and he is my pride and joy. He was one of the first "Ultimate" kids that came into our group. I have formed life long friendships through my association with Ultimate Hawaii and continue to stay in touch with all of those bruddahs and sistahs via my annual Pro Bowl trip.<br>
<br>I am very proud to have been voted into the Hall of Fame. My Hawaii life and all of those Ultimate years are a fond memory that I will always cherish. We had some great parties (remember our annual Pimp & Hooker and Lava Lava Sunglasses Parties!!)<br>
<br>
<b>Currently: (as of 2005):</b>:
I am currently back in my hometown - Sin City Las Vegas, I am in software application sales and still heavily involved in the motorcycle dirt bike world.<br>
