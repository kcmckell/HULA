<b>Years Played:</b> 1987-1991 & 1995-2001<br>
<br>
<b>Bio:</b> I played hard for my team & worked hard to help HULA and the Kaimana Klassik grow. Played at Kaimana I & at Summer Solstice with the Lava Rockers in 88 & 90. Helped Co-run the city league in 91 with Debbie Rubin & wrote the HULA News in 92-93<br>
<br>
<b>Words of Lore:</b>I look back fondly on when I watched new players learn to love the sport & its camaraderie. Always give a warm welcome to new players, encourage them whenever possible and go the extra yard to help them improve their game skills.<br>
<br>
<b>Most Memorable Achievement:</b> 1997 Started a short lived beginner's league called Renaissance Ultimate (no cleats ultimate).<br>
<br>
<b>Most Noteable Achievement:</b> 1995 began the HULA website and the HULA Hotline (back then many people did not have internet).<br>
