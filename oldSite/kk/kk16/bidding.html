<h2>Bidding</h2>
<h3>Here are the rules regarding the bidding process:

<p><ul><b><i>For teams:</i></b><p>
<li>Your bid may be as simple or elaborate as you wish (although we enjoy the elaborate ones a lot more), but at the very least include your name, email address, and phone number, and the number of people you honestly expect to have on your roster.
<li>All bids must be postmarked no later than <font  color="#ff0080" >November 1, 2002.  </font> Don't procrastinate - early bids are favored!
<li>The mailing address is the same for both Open and Women divisions: 
<br><center><font  color="#0000ff" >Buffy Cushman<br>2674 Hillside Ave.<br> Honolulu, HI 96822</font></center>

<li>A $300 initial deposit (payable to "HULA") must be submitted along with each bid as an indication of genuine interest.  This $300 deposit can later be applied to each individual's fee.  For those teams that do not make the final cut, we will refund your full deposit no later than December 10, 2002.
<li>Bid-winning teams will be notified via email (as will waitlisted teams) by November 15, 2002.  Bid-winning teams must respond via email or letter within 10 days whether or not they wish to accept the bid.  If no response is received, that team will forfeit its bid, and the next waitlisted team will be contacted.  At this point, the declining bid-winning team will receive a 100% refund on its deposit.
<li>Bid-winning teams are required to secure their bid by submitting entrance fees for at least half of their roster (at $120 per player) by<font  color="#ff0080"> December 15, 2002</font> (postmark date).
<li>If a bid-winning and bid-accepting team fails to submit the above mentioned players' fees, its bid will be lost, and again the next waitlisted team will be given priority.  If we are able to fill this new vacancy, we will issue only a partial deposit refund of $150. If we are unable to fill the vacancy, no refund of deposit will be issued.
<li>The remainder of each team's entrance fees are due by <font  color="#ff0080" >January 15, 2003.</font>  Any entrance fee postmarked after this date will be assessed the regular fee of $150.
<li><font  color="#ff0000" > If any team forfeits its position AFTER January 1, 2003, the deposit will be forfeited, regardless of our success in filling the vacancy.</font>
<p><b><i>For individuals</i></b><p>
<li>Individuals who do not belong to a team may play on the Aloha Spirit Team.  Early registration deadline is<font  color="#ff0080" > January 15, 2002.</font>
<li>In your individual bid, please include information on t-shirt size, meal preference (vegetarian or regular), email address, mailing address, and phone number.
<p><b><i>For Guests</i></b><p>
<li>Those who wish to join in the fun of the weekend, but do not wish to play, may register as guests.  Guests receive everything that a regular player does, with the exception of ultimate games.
<li>Guest fee is $65.</ul>
<p>
IMPORTANT:  Any single person may retract his or her bid from Kaimana Klassik at anytime, but if we are notified after January 15, 2003 of your individual intention to withdraw from the tournament, we will only issue a partial refund of your player fee ($60).
