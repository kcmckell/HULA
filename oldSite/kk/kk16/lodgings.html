<h2>Accomodations<br></h2>
<h3><B>Kaimana: (see camping link)</B></h3>
<font size=4>Camping is, of course, part of the Kaimana Klassik experience, and campsites will have been secured at Waimanalo State Recreation Area as part of the tourney.  We typically have the entire campsite reserved.  The advantages of camping with us at Waimanalo are numerous: it's easy to stumble home to late at night, there's no cost, the beach is beautiful, and you're very close to the fields.</font>
<h3><B>Bed and Breakfasts:</B></h3>
<font size=4>If you plan early there may be bed and breakfasts in the Waimanalo, Kailua, or Hawaii Kai areas (5 to 20 minutes away). This might be perfect if you're bringing your children.  It'll cost a little more but may make your nights easier.</font><br>
<br>
<h3><B>Hostels:</B></h3>
<font size=4>If you're coming sooner or staying longer, look into some of the hostels in Waikiki or up on the North Shore (they're a bit far from the fields so stay for camping during the tournament).</font><br>
<br>
<h3><B>Hotels:</B></h3>
<font size=4>The next step up are the hotels.  Waikiki has plenty, but they are about 45 minutes from the fields and if you're not familiar with getting to and from them it could take you longer. Please have a designated driver if you're staying for post-game activities.</font><br>
<br>
<h3><B>Weekly Rentals:</B></h3>
<font size=4>For home-style comfort you might consider a weekly rental.  Prices may be steep but with enough people you may be able to spread out the cost (don't surprise the property managers by not telling them how many are really staying over)</font><br>

<p><h2>Airfare</h2><br>
<font size=4>Kaimana Klassik does not offer airfare packages per se, but a long-time Kaimana friend and ultimate player owns an excellent travel agency in California which is particularly sensitive to the Kaimana Klassik player's needs.  If you are trying to arrange either individual travel, group flights, or car and flight package situations, visit the <a href="http://www.oakstravel.com"><b>Oaks Travel</b> </a>website.  When making your travel arrangements, don't forget the Big Island Hat Draw which follows Kaimana!</font>
