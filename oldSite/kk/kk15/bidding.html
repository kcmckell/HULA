<h2>Bidding</h2>
<h3>Here are the rules regarding the bidding process:

<p><ul><b><i>For teams:</i></b><p>
<li>Your bid may be as simple or elaborate as you wish, but at the very least include your name, email address, and phone number.
<li>All bids must be postmarked no later than <font  color="#ff0080" >November 1, 2001.  </font> Don't procrastinate - early bids are favored!
<li>The mailing address is the same for both Open and Womenz divisions: 
<br><center><font  color="#0000ff" >3164 Charles St.  Honolulu, HI 96816</font></center>
<li>For the Womenz division, address the letter to <font  color="#0000ff" >Jessica Wilkinson.</font>  For the Open division, address the letter to <font  color="#0000ff" >Corey Konkle.</font>
<li>A $300 initial deposit (payable to H.U.L.A.) must be submitted along with each bid as an indication of genuine interest.  This $300 deposit can later be applied to each individual's fee.
<li>Bid-winning teams will be notified via email (as will waitlisted teams).
<li>Bid-winning teams are required to secure their bid by submitting entrance fees for at least half of their roster (at $120 per player) by<font  color="#ff0080"> December 1, 2001</font> (postmark date).
<li>If a bid-winning bid team fails to submit the above mentioned players' fees, its bid will be lost, and the next waitlisted team will be given priority.
<li>The remainder of each team's entrance fees are due by <font  color="#ff0080" >January 15, 2002.</font>  Any entrance fee postmarked after this date will be assessed the regular fee of $150.
<li>In the event that a winning team forfeits its position after having received and accepted the invitation, the $300 deposit will not be returned unless we can fill the vacancy. <font  color="#ff0000" > If any team forfeits its position AFTER January 1, 2002, the deposit will be forfeited, regardless of our success in filling the vacancy.</font>
<p><b><i>For individuals</i></b><p>
<li>Individuals who do not belong to a team may play on the Aloha Spirit Team.  Early registration deadline is<font  color="#ff0080" > January 15, 2002.</font>
<li>In your individual bid, please include information on t-shirt size, meal preference (vegetarian or regular), email address, mailing address, and phone number.
<p><b><i>For Guests</i></b><p>
<li>Those who wish to join in the fun of the weekend, but do not wish to play, may register as guests.  Guests receive everything that a regular player does, with the exception of a t-shirt.
<li>Guest fee is $60.</ul>
