<h3>Aloha Ultimate Friends:
<br><br>
Kaimana Klassik XVI will be coming around the corner soon.  This website will go live beginning September 1, 2003, and all of the associated information for Kaimana 16 will be included.  In the meantime, we will once again look to have 16 women teams and 16 open teams.  The tournament is scheduled for Feb 15, 16, 17 2003.
<p><p>
For Kaimana XV, congratulations to Nada Mooger for taking the Open division title for the third year in a row, and to the Seven Green Bottles, the first-ever all-Australian women team for taking the womenz division title.<p>
Equally important, we also extend our congratulations to the Colorado Women and to the Doughboy Allstars for taking the much-coveted team spirit award.
<p>
We already have a slew of photos available for your viewing: <a href="http://members13.clubphoto.com/kaveh549549">Kaimana Photos</a>

Thanks again for the support.

KKXV</h3>
