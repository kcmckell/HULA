		<p class="title">Bids &amp; Fees </p>
		<p><strong>Current Info</strong> <span class="caption">(updated November 5, 2005)</span></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Player fee is $130.00 per player* this year. Fee includes all breakfasts and dinners, entertainment, camping, players' pack (cup, disc, and shirt), plus all field supplies (water, fruit, juice, EMT). The fee after January 15th, 2006 is $160.
          <li>If possible, all players should register through the <a href="http://www.itsportnet.com/league.php?scriptName=MEMBERLOGIN&leagueID=9680#" target="_blank">online registration system</a>.  Please utilize this service, since it makes it easier for us to organize rosters and preferences. If you cannot register online, please do so by sending a check to: Jena Kline, 2017 Mauna Place, Honolulu HI 96822.  Along with your check, include your team name, meal preference, and t-shirt size.
          <li>After January 15, 2006, late registration fee is $160.  Only players registering before January 15 are guaranteed their requested t-shirt size.  (Aloha Spirit players are not subject to the late registration fee)

		</ul>
		<p><strong>How to submit a team bid</strong><br>
		<ul>

	  <li>The October 31, 2005 deadline for team bids has passed.  We will notify bid-winning teams by November 15.  If you are still interested in entering a bid, send us the check and you will be put on the waitlist and contacted if there are any openings for teams. Priority will be given to waitlisted teams in the order that bids are received. We are currently only accepting bids via mail, so send in your bids now!  
	  <li>All bids must include (for online bids we will be in contact for additional information): </p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Contact information for captain or organizer, including name, email address, and phone number(s)
          <li>The number of players you actually anticipate having on your roster come February, as well as the number you have that are currently committed
          <li>$390 deposit (3 player fees); U.S. dollars, payable to Kaimana Klassik
          <li><em>We hope your bid will also be fun, original, and convincing! It can be in any format you wish... let us know what your team will contribute to Kaimana 19! </em>
          <li>Send all bids to: Jena Kline, 2017 Mauna Place, Honolulu, HI 96822
          <li>Please read below for detailed information about the bid fees. </li>
        </ul>
		<p><strong>TEAM BID REGISTRATION</strong><br>
		Caveats of the bidding process:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The $390 initial deposit can later be applied to three individual player's fees (the captain plus two other players). For those teams that do not make the final cut, we will refund your full deposit no later than December 10, 2005.
          <li>Bid-winning teams will be notified via email (as will wait-listed teams) by November 15, 2005. Bid-winning teams must respond via e-mail or letter within 15 days of notification, whether or not they wish to accept the bid. If no response is received, that team will forfeit its bid, and the next wait-listed team will be contacted. At this point, the declining bid-winning team will receive a 100% refund on its deposit.
          <li>Bid-winning teams are required to secure their bid by submitting entrance fees for at least half of their roster (at $130 per player) by December 15, 2005 (postmark date).
          <li>If a bid-winning and bid-accepting team fails to submit the above mentioned players' fees, its bid will be lost, and the next wait-listed team will be given priority. If we are able to fill this new vacancy, we will issue only a partial deposit refund of $160. If we are unable to fill the vacancy, no refund of deposit will be issued.
          <li>The remainders of each team's entrance fees are due by January 15, 2006. Any entrance fee postmarked after this date will be assessed the late registration fee of $160.
          <li>If any team forfeits its position after January 1, 2006, the deposit will be forfeited, regardless of our success in filling the vacancy.          <li><em>*Kaimana fees are based on an ideal budget divided by a realistic average of the number of players who have attended the tournament in recent years. Any excess monies earned by the tournament go towards supporting the events, activities, and outreach of the Hawaii Ultimate League Association (HULA). </em></li>
