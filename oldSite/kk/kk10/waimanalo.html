Polo Fields</b></font></p>

<p>From the Honolulu Airport get on the freeway called
&quot;H1&quot; going East. Follow this road until you are there
(Waimanalo). Along the way the road changes name (to
Kalanianiaole Hwy) and reduces to a two-lane road shortly before
Hanauma Bay. You'll follow the South coast past Hanauma Bay, and
then go around the point and up the East shore. Eight miles after
Hanauma Bay you'll pass the Waimanalo McDonalds. One-third of a
mile past McDonalds, on the left, is the entrance to the Polo
Fields where the games will be held. Across the street from the
polo fields is the Waimanalo Bay State Recreation area where
camping is provided.</p>
