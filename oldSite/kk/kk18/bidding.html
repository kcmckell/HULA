<br>Caveats of the bidding process<br>
<li>The $300 initial deposit can later be applied to two individual player’s fees (the captain plus one other player).  The remainder will be reimbursed to the captain at the tournament.  For those teams that do not make the final cut, we will refund your full deposit no later than December 10, 2004. </li>
<li>Bid-winning teams will be notified via email (as will wait-listed teams) by November 15, 2004. Bid-winning teams must respond via e-mail or letter within 15 days of notification, whether or not they wish to accept the bid. If no response is received, that team will forfeit its bid, and the next wait-listed team will be contacted. At this point, the declining bid-winning team will receive a 100% refund on its deposit. </li>
<li>Bid-winning teams are required to secure their bid by submitting entrance fees for at least half of their roster (at $126.50 per player) by December 15, 2004 (postmark date). </li>
<li>If a bid-winning and bid-accepting team fails to submit the above mentioned players' fees, its bid will be lost, and the next wait-listed team will be given priority. If we are able to fill this new vacancy, we will issue only a partial deposit refund of $160. If we are unable to fill the vacancy, no refund of deposit will be issued. </li>
<li>The remainders of each team’s entrance fees are due by January 15, 2005. Any entrance fee postmarked after this date will be assessed the late registration fee of $160. </li>
<li>If any team forfeits its position after January 1, 2005, the deposit will be forfeited, regardless of our success in filling the vacancy.</li>
<br>
<li><i>*Kaimana fees are based on an ideal budget divided by a realistic average of the number of players who have attended the tournament in recent years. Any excess monies earned by the tournament go towards supporting the events, activities, and outreach of the Hawaii Ultimate League Association (HULA). </i></li>
