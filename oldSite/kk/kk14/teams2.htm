<br>Aloha!   Welcome to the Kaimana Klassik<br>
<br>
For ease in transitioning to the tournament, the Kaimana Kommittee has established very important deadlines of which the Captains need to be aware.  We have done our best in creating enough time for all the teams to be able to register fully prior to arriving to the Waimanalo Polo Fields.    We look forward to another great tournament this year, with 16 Open Division teams and 15 Womenz Division teams!<br>
<br>
1.  DECEMBER 8TH (Friday)<br>
<br>
This is the Captain's deadline to turn in 1/2 of your team's early registration fees.  The early registration fee has been established at $120 per player.  Remember that you have already paid for 2.5 players with your $300 deposit check, so calculate accordingly and work out that deduction among your team, if you can.<br>
<br>
We are also requesting your TEAM ROSTER (as realistic as possible). Indicate on your roster whose fees have been paid for through the deposit and the 1/2 early registrations.  (For those of you who have sent a roster - thank you.  If you don't mind sending an updated one, or email us re: who your 1/2 registration fees are being applied to, that would be fine)<br>
<br>
Of course, if you wish, you can send us your roster and ALL team registrations by December 8th.<br>
<br>
PLEASE WRITE ALL CHECKS TO H.U.L.A (not to Kirk or Lori).  Indicate on your check your team name and the division.<br>
<br>
Please send the roster and the 1/2 early registration fees to (same address as before):  HULA c/o Lori Daniels, 1902 Bertram Street, Honolulu, HI 96816<br>
<br>
The December 8th deadline is also an opportunity to tell us if (for some reason) you will NOT be able to field a team, though you have been granted a bid.  If this is the case, then notify us as soon as possible.  We will gladly refund your deposit, and your immediate notification to us regarding this will provide us with ample opportunity to invite one of the wait-list teams to participate.<br>
<br>
2.  JANUARY 12TH (Friday)<br>
<br>
Captain's deadline for remaining balance of team's EARLY registration fees ($120/player) and Registration forms.  Registration Forms will be posted on the web-site, which you and your team members can down-load.  Captains are responsible (like in previous years) for gathering all your players' registration fees and registration forms and sending them in one mailing to the address above.  We do not want independent mailings from individual players.  Please inform your team members to provide you with their completed registration forms (with shirt sizes and food preferences indicated).<br>
<br>
(Aloha Spirit - this One Mailing issue does not apply to you, due to your Pick-up status.  However, we need to have your registration forms and player fees to be mailed to us by January 12th)<br>
<br>
After the January 12th deadline, the regular registration will be in effect ($150 per player). <br>
<br>
This is also the LAST deadline date for informing the Coordinators if you are unable to field a team.  Should you NOT inform us by January 12th, and you end up not fielding a  team, you will have forfeited your $300 deposit.  You MUST communicate with the Coordinators if this possibility exists. <br>
<br>
Mahalo nui loa (Thank you very much ) for your attention to these important dates and for getting your teams together!!    <br>
