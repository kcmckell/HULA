<h1>Camping<br></h1></center>
We've got camping for Friday, Saturday, Sunday & Monday night. 
The campgrounds close around noon Tuesday and stay closed (Tuesday night no camping).<br>
<br>
Campsites will be provided across the street from the ultimate fields (Waimanalo Polo Club).  Campsites will be available (reserved) at &quot;Sherwood Forrest&quot; (Waimanalo Beach Park).  The entrance is practically directly across the street from the fields, but the walk to and from the campsites is approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  The park includes some of the best stretches of beach in the world with the designated campsites beneath the ironwood trees.  Additional campsites will be available (reserved) at Bellows Beach.  These campsites are also very close to the fields, but walking to and from the Bellows campsites from and to the fields is not recommended, unless you have a half-hour or so to spare.  <BR>

For all campsites, tents must be in the designated camp area or you will be asked to move by camp security (definitely not worth the hassle).  Both campsites have &quot;basic&quot; bathrooms (generally with T.P. but not with soap and paper towels) and cold water showers.  Fires are only permitted in fire pits.  Security is strict about their fire policy (definitely not worth the hassle).  Bring rain gear and weather proof tents.  Nighttime weather can be cool (low 60’s).  Gates for vehicular traffic to Sherwood close at 7:00 p.m.  Access by foot is not limited.  DO NOT LEAVE VALUABLES AT THE CAMP SITES!!!  Hawaii does have some greedy, unfriendly souls who prey on easy targets.<BR><BR>
