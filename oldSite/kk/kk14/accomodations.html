<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Bed and Breakfasts:</B></FONT><br>
If you plan early there may be bed and breakfasts in the Waimanalo, Kailua, or Hawaii Kai areas (5 to 20 minutes away). This might be perfect if you're bringing your children.  It'll cost a little more but may make your nights easier.<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Hostels:</B></FONT><br>
If you're coming sooner or staying longer look into some of the hostels in Waikiki or up on the North Shore. (they're a bit far from the fields so stay for camping during the tournament).<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Hotels:</B></FONT><br>
The next step up are the hotels.  Waikiki has plenty, but they are about 45 minutes from the fields and if you're not familiar with getting to and from them it could take you longer. Please have a designated driver if you're staying for post-game activities.<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Weekly Rentals:</B></FONT><br>
For home-style comfort you might consider a weekly rental.  Prices may be steep but with enough people you may be able to spread out the cost (don't surprise the property manager by not telling them how many are really staying over)<br>
