<font size="+1">The celebration has ended for another year<br>
(unless your going to Maui this weekend).<br>
<br><br>
<font size=+2> Nada Mooger - Open Teams Champions</font><br>
Nada Mooger beat Grey Tide in a great finals.<br>
The final score was 19-16.<br>
Crisp plays, great spirit by both teams and lots of hucks made for a perfect finale to the tournament.
<br><br>
<font size=+2>Shambala - Women's Team Champions</font><br>
Shambala played the finals against Awiki Na Wahine.<br>
The game was very close and the final score was 17-15.<br>
One of Shambala's players, Amy Dobras, was the big crowd pleaser in the game getting a Hat Trick with three massive gnarly & hairy baps when the score was 15-14.  This was truly a great game to watch and I for one was glad that the women's and open finals were staggered .<br>
