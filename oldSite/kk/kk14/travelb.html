<FONT SIZE="4"><B><a name="Camping">Camping</a>:</B></FONT><br>
We've got camping for Friday, Saturday, Sunday & Monday night.<br>
The campgrounds close around noon Tuesday and stay closed<br>
Tuesday night (no camping).<br>
<br>
Campsites will be provided across the street from the ultimate fields (Waimanalo Polo Club).  Campsites will be available (reserved) at &quot;Sherwood Forrest&quot; (Waimanalo Beach Park).  The entrance is practically directly across the street from the fields, but the walk to and from the campsites is approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  The park includes some of the best stretches of beach in the world (as published in numerous independent &quot;studies&quot;), with the designated campsites beneath the ironwood trees.  Additional campsites will be available (reserved) at Bellows Beach.  These campsites are also very close to the fields, but walking to and from the Bellows campsites from and to the fields is not recommended, unless you have a half-hour or so to spare.  <BR><BR>

For all campsites, tents must be in the designated camp area or you will be asked to move by camp security (definitely not worth the hassle).  Both campsites have &quot;basic&quot; bathrooms (generally with T.P. but not with soap and paper towels) and cold water showers.  Fires are only permitted in fire pits.  Security is strict about their fire policy (definitely not worth the hassle).  Bring rain gear and weather proof tents.  Nighttime weather can be cool (low 60’s).  Gates for vehicular traffic to Sherwood close at 7:00 p.m.  Access by foot is not limited.  DO NOT LEAVE VALUABLES AT THE CAMP SITES!!!  Hawaii does have some greedy, unfriendly souls who prey on easy targets.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="4"><B><a name="Meals">Meals:</a></B></FONT><br>
 Player fees include Friday night dinner, Saturday breakfast and<br>
dinner. Sunday breakfast and dinner and Monday breakfast.<br>
Lunches will be available at the fields by our caterer at your own cost. <br><br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Other Meal Options:</B></FONT><br>
McDonalds is across the street from the fields. Next door to McD's is Mel's<br>
Market, a ma & pa grocery store selling almost everything including killer<br>
ahi poke(raw fish Hawaiian style). Down the road a little is Keneke's BBQ<br>
serving kick ass plate lunches Hawaiian style. next to that you can get<br>
shaved ice and there is even a 7-eleven.<br><br>
In the other direction (a left from the field gate)<br>
down the road about two miles are Subway, Jack in the Box, a few<br>
other takeout places, a fresh fruit stand and a small supermarket.<br><br>
Another option is driving 15 minutes to Kailua, which has<br>
 Food, Drug and Department Stores, Pizza, Starbucks, Nice Restaurants, etc.<br>

<FONT SIZE="4"><B><a name="Around">Getting Around Oahu</a></B></FONT><br><br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Car Rentals:</B></FONT><br>
Hertz, Avis, Alamo & Dollar are always good choices.<br>
Call around for the best price and availability.<br>
<br>
To assist in your travels, especially if you are renting a car, consider purchasing a Bryan’s Sectional Maps of O’ahu (a book of street maps) for approximately $ 8.00.  Bryan’s Maps are well detailed and well organized, with a comprehensive glossary by street name, park name, etc.<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Taxi:</B></FONT><br>
The cost could be up to $50.00 plus baggage charges and tip.<br>
Ask to go to Waimanalo (H3 or the Pali Highway are the recommended routes)<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>The Bus:</B></FONT><br>
Coming on a shoestring budget?<br>
You can catch the <a href="http://www.thebus.org" TARGET="_top">Oahu city bus</a> to the fields<br>
from the airport. Its not recommended, but can be done.<br>
Some bus drivers won't let you on with your pack,<br>
especially if the bus is crowded or if its rush hour.<br>
The trick would be letting the driver know you<br>
will hold the backpack in your lap in your seat<br>
Catch a #19 or #20 Waikiki or Ala Moana bus from the airport.<br>
Get off Downtown at Alakea St. (ah lah kay ya) and catch<br>
the #57 Kailua-Waimanalo or Kailua-Sea Life Park<br>
(DO NOT get on the #57 the Kailua-Keolu)<br>
Ask the bus driver nicely to let you off at<br>
the Waimanalo Polo Fields (one stop after Bellows Beach Park)<br>
Come over to the fields starting around 3:00 PM and<br>
we'll take good care of you.  <br>
Make sure to give yourself plenty of time to get back to<br>
the airport on Monday (the bus is on holiday schedule)<br>

<FONT SIZE="4"><B><a name="Accomodations">Other Accommodations</a>:</B></FONT><br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Bed and Breakfasts:</B></FONT><br>
If you plan early there may be bed and breakfasts<br>
in the Waimanalo, Kailua, or Hawaii Kai areas (5 to 20 minutes away).<br>
This might be perfect if you're bringing your children.  It'll cost<br>
a little more but may make your nights easier.<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Hostels:</B></FONT><br>
If you're coming sooner or staying longer<br>
look into some of the hostels in Waikiki or up<br>
on the North Shore. (they're a bit far from the<br>
fields so stay for camping during the tournament).<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Hotels:</B></FONT><br>
The next step up are the hotels.  Waikiki has<br>
plenty, but they are about 45 minutes from the<br>
fields and if you're not familiar with getting<br>
to and from them it could take you longer.<br>
Please have a designated driver if you're staying<br>
for post-game activities.<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Weekly Rentals:</B></FONT><br>
For home-style comfort you might consider a<br>
weekly rental.  Prices may be steep but with<br>
enough people you may be able to spread out<br>
the cost (don't surprise the property manager by<br>
not telling them how many are really staying over)<br>

<a name="Things"><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Things to do:</B></FONT></a><br>
Pipeline, Sunset Beach, Waimea Bay (be cautious in large surf.  Consult lifeguards regarding conditions).  Haleiwa town (historical town, cool art galleries, etc.).  Waiamea Falls (botanical garden, ATC tours, Mountain Bike tours).  Kualoa Ranch.  Camping is also available at Mokuleia (tents) and Malaekahana State Recreation Area (tents or cabins, if you can reserve one).  Camping permits must be obtained (call (808) 587-0300 for State parks or (808) 523-4527 for City &amp; County parks, including the sites used for tournament camping).  Closer to Honolulu (south shore) there is the Waikiki Aquarium, Honolulu Zoo, Diamond Head Crater (a vigorous 25-minute hike to the rim overlooking Honolulu), Hanauma Bay (snorkeling), Sandy’s Beach (watch out for the shore break), Makapuu Beach.<BR><BR>

Hiking – We strongly recommend going with someone who knows where they are going or, at a minimum, obtain trail information and maps from the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources or the city and county of Honolulu.  Do not drink the stream water in Hawaii (sad but true).  Carry tap or bottled water.  Hawaii does not have snakes or real nasty spiders (although cane spiders are larger than tarantulas and can be quite intimidating).  We do have small scorpions (similar to a wasp sting) and centipedes.  We also have jellyfish (cyclical with the moons).  The jelly fish look like blue transparent bubbles on the water (Portuguese man-o-war) or larger (softball size?) Box jelly fish.  <BR><BR>

Mountain Biking – There are some excellent, relatively technical, mostly single-track, bike trails on Oahu.  For trail information, try calling The Bike Factory (808) 596-8844, McCully Bicycle (808) 955-6329, or The Dirt Zone (808) 487 dirt.<BR><BR>
