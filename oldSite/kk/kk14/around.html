<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Car Rentals:</B></FONT><br>
Hertz, Avis, Alamo & Dollar are always good choices. Call around for the best price and availability.<br>
<br>
To assist in your travels, especially if you are renting a car, consider purchasing a Bryan’s Sectional Maps of O’ahu (a book of street maps) for approximately $ 8.00.  Bryan’s Maps are well detailed and well organized, with a comprehensive glossary by street name, park name, etc.<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Taxi:</B></FONT><br>
The cost could be up to $50.00 plus baggage charges and tip. Ask to go to Waimanalo/Bellows Beach Park/Waimanalo McDonalds (H3 or the Pali Highway are the recommended routes)<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>The Bus:</B></FONT><br>
Coming on a shoestring budget? You can catch the <a href="http://www.thebus.org" TARGET="_top">Oahu city bus</a> to the fields from the airport. Its not recommended, but can be done. Some bus drivers won't let you on with your pack, especially if the bus is crowded or if its rush hour. The trick would be letting the driver know you will hold the backpack in your lap in your seat Catch a #19 or #20 Waikiki or Ala Moana bus from the airport. Get off Downtown at Alakea St. (ah lah kay ya) and catch the #57 Kailua-Waimanalo or Kailua-Sea Life Park (DO NOT get on the #57 the Kailua-Keolu) Ask the bus driver nicely to let you off at the Waimanalo Polo Fields (one stop after Bellows Beach Park) Come over to the fields starting around 3:00 PM and we'll take good care of you.  <br><br>
Make sure to give yourself plenty of time to get back to the airport on Monday (the bus is on holiday schedule)<br>
