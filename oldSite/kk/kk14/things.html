<h1>Things to do<br></h1></center>
Pipeline, Sunset Beach, Waimea Bay (be cautious in large surf.  Consult lifeguards regarding conditions).  Haleiwa town (historical town, cool art galleries, etc.).  Waiamea Falls (botanical garden, ATC tours, Mountain Bike tours).  Kualoa Ranch.  Camping is also available at Mokuleia (tents) and Malaekahana State Recreation Area (tents or cabins, if you can reserve one).  Camping permits must be obtained (call (808) 587-0300 for State parks or (808) 523-4527 for City &amp; County parks, including the sites used for tournament camping).  Closer to Honolulu (south shore) there is the Waikiki Aquarium, Honolulu Zoo, Diamond Head Crater (a vigorous 25-minute hike to the rim overlooking Honolulu), Hanauma Bay (snorkeling), Sandy’s Beach (watch out for the shore break), Makapuu Beach.<BR><BR>

Hiking – We strongly recommend going with someone who knows where they are going or, at a minimum, obtain trail information and maps from the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources or the city and county of Honolulu.  Do not drink the stream water in Hawaii (sad but true).  Carry tap or bottled water.  Hawaii does not have snakes or real nasty spiders (although cane spiders are larger than tarantulas and can be quite intimidating).  We do have small scorpions (similar to a wasp sting) and centipedes.  We also have jellyfish (cyclical with the moons).  The jelly fish look like blue transparent bubbles on the water (Portuguese man-o-war) or larger (softball size?) Box jelly fish.  <BR><BR>

Mountain Biking – There are some excellent, relatively technical, mostly single-track, bike trails on Oahu.  For trail information, try calling The Bike Factory (808) 596-8844, McCully Bicycle (808) 955-6329, or The Dirt Zone (808) 487 dirt.<BR><BR>
