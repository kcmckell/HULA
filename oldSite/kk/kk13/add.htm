<B>The 13<SUP>th</SUP> Annual Kaimana Klassik Ultimate Tournament<br>
"The Dawn of a New Age of Ultimate"</B></P>

(Update, February 4, 2000)  The Kaimana is rapidly approaching. Your dedicated Kaimana Klassik Team and a bevy of volunteers are working feverishly to bring you the best Ultimate Tournament we can.  The teams are set, you have your plane tickets, we’ve contracted the caterers, the bands, the beer, the discs, the shirts, the fields, etc.  Last night was the traditional &quot;camp out for the camp out&quot; wherein about fifteen brave souls slept in downtown Honolulu to guarantee that you, the spirited participant, have a &quot;primo&quot; campsite alongside the rest of the Kaimana Family.  We have secured enough campsites within about 5 minutes of the fields by car to accommodate the entire Kaimana Tournament!!  (see &quot;Tournament Camping&quot;, below, for further details).<BR><BR>

We are ecstatic to welcome an international field at this year’s Kaimana.  This is our 13<SUP>th</SUP> annual tournament and each and every year has been a joy to behold.  For all you folks that have been socked in with winter weather, we hope the warmth of the islands provides you with an embrace of Aloha.  For the neighbor island participants, part of our extended o’hana, e komo mai bruddahs and seestahs!!!!  We look forward to seeing you again, ready to go ho Hawaiian Style.<BR><BR>

<B>ADDITIONAL TOURNAMENT INFORMATION:<BR><BR>

Pre-tourney stuffs:</B>  Starting around 6:30 p.m., Wednesday night, February 16th, pick-up ultimate at Kapaolono Field, between 11<SUP>th</SUP> and 12 Avenues in Kaimuki.  There are two small, fairly rough, but very fun, fields.  Lights stay on until approximately 9:30, with traditional frivolity to follow.  Starting around 5:00 p.m. on Thursday night, February 17th, pick-up ultimate at Ala Moana Regional Park, near &quot;Magic Island&quot;.  The sun sets around 6:30ish (no lights on these fields).  The pre-tournament social/party will follow Thursday Night pick-up.  Details to follow shortly, stay tuned.<BR><BR>
<B>
Tournament Camping:  </B>Campsites will be provided across the street from the ultimate fields (Waimanalo Polo Club).  Campsites will be available (reserved) at &quot;Sherwood Forrest&quot; (Waimanalo Beach Park).  The entrance is practically directly across the street from the fields, but the walk to and from the campsites is approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  The park includes some of the best stretches of beach in the world (as published in numerous independent &quot;studies&quot;), with the designated camp sites beneath the ironwood trees.  Additional camp sites will be available (reserved) at Bellows Beach.  These campsites are also very close to the fields, but walking to and from the Bellows campsites from and to the fields is not recommended, unless you have a half hour or so to spare.  <BR><BR>

For all camp sites, tents must be in the designated camp area or you will be asked to move by camp security (definitely not worth the hassle).  Both camp sites have &quot;basic&quot; bathrooms (generally with T.P. but not with soap and paper towels) and cold water showers.  Fires are only permitted in fire pits.  Security is strict about their fire policy (definitely not worth the hassle).  Bring rain gear and weather proof tents.  Night time weather can be cool (low 60’s).  Gates for vehicular traffic to Sherwood close at 7:00 p.m.  Access by foot is not limited.  DO NOT LEAVE VALUABLES AT THE CAMP SITES!!!  Hawaii does have some greedy, unfriendly souls who prey on easy targets.<BR><BR>

<B>Food:&#9;</B>Dinner and breakfast will be supplied (see schedule).  Lunches will be available from a private caterer (pay as you grind…uh..eat).  McDonald’s is within walking distance of the fields.  A little further is Mel’s Market (a small local grocery), a local &quot;plate lunch&quot; BarBQ store, a shave ice (snow cone) shop.<BR><BR>

<B>Additional Accommodations:</B>  For those arriving early and/or staying late (Big Island Hat Draw?), the following is a list of hostels available on Oahu.  (I have not visited any of the hostels listed and this information is not to be construed as an endorsement or recommendation.  In other words, if you don’t like the accommodations, don’t blame me, I’m just trying to help out.).<BR>

<B>Things to do:  </B>Pipeline, Sunset Beach, Waimea Bay (be cautious in large surf.  Consult lifeguards regarding conditions).  Haleiwa town (historical town, cool art galleries, etc.).  Waiamea Falls (botanical garden, ATC tours, Mountain Bike tours).  Kualoa Ranch.  Camping is also available at Mokuleia (tents) and Malaekahana State Recreation Area (tents or cabins, if you can reserve one).  Camping permits must be obtained (call (808) 587-0300 for State parks or (808) 523-4527 for City &amp; County parks, including the sites used for tournament camping).  Closer to Honolulu (south shore) there is the Waikiki Aquarium, Honolulu Zoo, Diamond Head Crater (a vigorous 25-minute hike to the rim overlooking Honolulu), Hanauma Bay (snorkeling), Sandy’s Beach (watch out for the shore break), Makapuu Beach.<BR><BR>

Hiking – We strongly recommend going with someone who knows where they are going or, at a minimum, obtain trail information and maps from the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources or the city and county of Honolulu.  Do not drink the stream water in Hawaii (sad but true).  Carry tap or bottled water.  Hawaii does not have snakes or real nasty spiders (although cane spiders are larger than tarantulas and can be quite intimidating).  We do have small scorpions (similar to a wasp sting) and centipedes.  We also have jellyfish (cyclical with the moons).  The jelly fish look like blue transparent bubbles on the water (Portuguese man-o-war) or larger (softball size?) Box jelly fish.  <BR><BR>

Mountain Biking – There are some excellent, relatively technical, mostly single-track, bike trails on Oahu.  For trail information, try calling The Bike Factory (808) 596-8844, McCully Bicycle (808) 955-6329, or The Dirt Zone (808) 487 dirt.  If you get desperate, call me at (808) 262-1171.<BR><BR>

<B>Transportation – </B>Honolulu is served by most U.S. domestic rental car chains.  Also, we have a decent (good?) bus system.  Simply called The Bus, you can get most places on Oahu for a buck ($1.00).  See <A HREF="http://www.thebus.org/"><FONT SIZE=2>www.thebus.org</FONT></A>.  
(Note from a bus rider) The bus can refuse to let you on with a large backpack, or they may be nice and let you on.  The bus that goes to Kaimana at the Waimanalo Polo Fields is the #57, Kailua - Waimanalo or #57 Kailua - Sea Life Park, but not the #57 Kailua- Keolu (go figure).  Ask the bus driver nicely to let you off one stop after Bellows Beach Park. <BR>
<br>
To assist in your travels, especially if you are renting a car, consider purchasing a Bryan’s Sectional Maps of O’ahu (a book of street maps) for approximately $ 8.00.  Bryan’s Maps are well detailed and well organized, with a comprehensive glossary by street name, park name, etc.<BR><BR>

Hope the above information helps you to have the time of your lives while you’re in the Land of Aloha.  Also, make plans to get to the Big Island on February 25 through 27 for the Hat Draw Tournament (see link on this page and HULA home page).<BR><BR>
