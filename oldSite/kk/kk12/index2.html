<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>CAMPING:</B></FONT> camping will be provided across the street from the polo fields at<br>
Sherwood Forest(waimanalo beach). The entrance is almost directly across<br>
the entrance from the polo fields. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the<br>
campsites from the fields. this campsite is right on the beach but the<br>
designated areas to camp are under the ironwood trees. tents must be<br>
pitched in the designated areas or you will be asked to move them by<br>
security. There are nice sized bathrooms with cold water showers. At these<br>
campsites, fires are only permitted in the designated pits. I recommend<br>
light rain gear for the nights. we usually get a little drizzle in the<br>
middle of the night and the ironwoods do serve as a bit of coverage. the<br>
night time beach weather is nippy but not cold. those of us acclimated to<br>
Hawaiian weather have become cold wimps, you guys will probably be hot.<br>
the gates for vehicular traffic into the campsites locks at 7:00pm but<br>
foot traffic is accessible at all times. DO NOT LEAVE ANY VALUABLES AT THE<br>
CAMPSITE. KEEP ALL VALUABLES WITH YOU DURING THE DAY WHILE<BR>
AT THE POLO FIELDS.<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Meals:</B></FONT> Player fees include Friday night dinner, Saturday breakfast and<br>
dinner. Sunday breakfast and luau dinner, monday breakfast and BBQ. Lunch<br>
will be available at the fields by our caterer at your own cost. other<br>
lunch options at your own cost, McDonalds across the street from the<br>
fields. Next door to McD's is Mel's Market, a ma & pa grocery store<br>
selling almost everything including killer ahi poke(raw fish Hawaiian<br>
style). Down the road a little is keneke's BBQ serving kick ass plate<br>
lunches Hawaiian style. next to that you can get shaved ice and there is<br>
even a 7-eleven. Mcd's and mel's market are only about 10-15 minutes<br>
walking, keneke's is about 5 minutes driving. although there is a<br>
McDonalds and a 7-eleven don't let the corporation bum your aloha spirit,<br>
you are still in the middle of waimanalo country guarded on one side by a<br>
GREEN wall of Ancient lava with the ocean on the other side.<br>
