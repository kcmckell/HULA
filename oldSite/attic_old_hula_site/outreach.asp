<br><p>The <b>Hawaii Outreach Program (HOP)</b> is the name given to the collective
efforts of HULA members who have invested time and energy into sharing our
wonderful sport with the rest of our state.

<p>Worlds has come and gone, but what remains is a family of wonderful people
who love sharing the joy and aloha of Ultimate.

<p>Want to learn more about the invigorating sport called "ULTIMATE"?

<p>Anyone with ideas or contacts through which we can share our sport with the
community is encouraged to step forward. HOP's constantly growing pool of
enthusiastic Ultimate-teaching professionals will do its best to accomadate
organizations of any shape or size.  In the past, we've taught school P.E.
classes, scout troops, summer fun and church youth groups.

<p>Anyone interested in teaching Ultimate should also get in touch with Brent
Tamamoto (<a href="mailto:btamamoto@hawaiiultimate.com">btamamoto@hawaiiultimate.com</a>)
so that he can add you to his list.<br><br>
