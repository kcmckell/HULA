<a name="Section 2.01">Section 2.01</a> PURPOSE. </B> The purpose of HULA is to encourage and promote disc-related activities including Ultimate, Disc Golf, Freestyle, Double Disc Court and Footbags as well as to promote the Spirit of the Game concept through regular league play, tournaments and educational programs for both youth and adults.<BR>
<BR>
<B><a name="Section 2.02">Section 2.02</a> ANNUAL AGENDA. </B> Each year HULA shall draw up an annual agenda of goals along with a budget that includes:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>The Kaimana Klassik Tournament and Hopu Ka Lewa Tournament;</LI>
<LI>Two Ultimate seasons;</LI>
<LI>At least one disc golf tournament;</LI>
<LI>At least one outreach program for youth and/or the general public;</LI>
<LI>Other disc related activities at the discretion of the HULA Board of Directors.</LI></OL>

<b><a name="Section 2.03">Section 2.03</a> ULTIMATE TOURNAMENTS.</b> Each year HULA shall sponsor two large ultimate tournaments, The Kaimana Klassik and Hopu Ka Lewa.
<OL type="A">
<li>The Kaimana Klassik Tournament generally will take place on Presidents' Day weekend of each year.  This tournament will consist of Open and Women's competitive tournament play.  At least one bid must be reserved in each division for an Oahu team, and one bid in each division must be reserved for a neighbor island team.</li>

<li>The Hopu Ka Lewa Tournament generally will take place on a Spring weekend each year.  Hopu Ka Lewa will consist of coed (mixed) tournament play, with a maximum of 16 teams per tournament.  Celebration of Spirit of the Game is of paramount importance to Hopu.  A goal of Hopu is to strengthen coed (mixed) play in Hawai'i, and will therefore encourage everyone in the Hawai'i ultimate community to play or participate in the tournament.  As a result, no legitimate bid from a Hawai'i team will be denied.  Any profit from fees received (after deducting subsidies provided by HULA) shall be used for Outreach purposes, except that the Hopu Committee may retain sufficient funds from such profits to maintain an account equal to 1/4 the cost of the previous year's tournament to be used as seed money for the next year's tournament.</li>
