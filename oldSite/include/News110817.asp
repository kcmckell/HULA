Whaddup HULA, ready for some rainy ultimate?  WE ARE.
<BR><BR>
With the conclusion of Solid Gold Kaimana Klassik 24, where beer was drunk, wine was spilled, and whiskey shot while the sweet, salty smell of bacon filled the bigtop tent, we say aloha to our mainland and international guests and get back to local ultimate.  Starting with, of course, SPRING LEAUGE 2011 (link at right).  With new online paypal payment and a strict crew, this is gaurenteed to be an exciting league.  And don't mind the rain, it just makes for more layouts (but dress accordingly and bring a trash bag for your stuff).  The rain definitely didn't bother the 30-or-so hardcore ultimate fans (two guys even bussed it w/ bikes) who made it to the opening hat draw March 5 in Waimanalo.  See you there STARTING FRIDAY 3/11.

Keeping the momentum up after Kaimana, Clay "Dukes" M. is continuing the men's ultimate charge with Sunday high-level scrimmages at Makiki District Park.  Join Kanemail (below) to be included.  Please be informed, this game is of an intermediate to advanced level of ultimate.  Typically we play a series of 5 or 7 point games with discussiones in between, all aiming towards increasing the intensity of Hawaii men's ultimate for tournaments like Kaimana.
