Aloha HULA!  Check it out, fastest update ever.

With Yo Ho Hopu Ka Lewa sailing away into the sunset marking (what I think was, although I may be biased) the GREATEST HOPU EVER (cheers, Megan and Chris S.), teams are already amassing for <a href="kk/kk24" target="blank">Kaimana Klassik 24</a>, February 19-21, 2011.  TEAM BIDS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED, so go git your game one.  O`ahu players, if you haven't gotten on a team yet, start askin' around!  As far as the men go, there is Bag-O-Wine (cap'n Justin R.) and Beer4Breakfast (cap'n Jess K., the worst cap'n ever....but not a bad webmaster?) who will be jointly practicing mostly at Makiki District Park Sundays at 11am.  There are still spots available on both teams.  If the captains of the neighbor island and O`ahu women's teams would like to send a shoutout here, lemme know.

Fall League 2010 is living up to all the hype, got a LOT of new faces out there rockin' Koko Head District Park.  We are having UNPRECEDENTED attendance with entire teams showing up long before gametime.  A few fun and interesting rules we've instated seem to be working out well with the first games sometimes starting up to 5 minutes BEFORE schedule and solid games continuing the week after Hopu with a quarter of our community away on the Big Island for the post-Hopu Hat Draw.  Glad you guys are diggin' it! (for more info click link at right).  We are definitely enjoying running it.

PICKUP is turning epic.  I hear reports that Tuesday Ala Moana Pickup is regularly running 2 fields with subs!  Vu continues running Recreational League (Rec Night, more info in link at right) before Thursday pickup at Kapaolono Park and pickup has been solid partially because of them.  Go out and help some beginners early or just go out and school them after Rec Night in open pickup!  There's even talk of a semi-regular game forming on the Windward side (Kailua I believe).  I'm working on making that happen, stay tuned!
