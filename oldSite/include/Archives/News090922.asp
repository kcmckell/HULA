First and foremost, a special thank you goes out to Bill Voss and Jennifer Milholen for running a wonderful <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Spring2009" target="blank">Spring League 2009</a> Which ended on June 13, 2009.  Even with league-provided refreshments at every Saturday evening game and a wonderful season-ending party, Bill and Jennifer managed to turn a profit for HULA!

Also, with the conclusion of fall league also brings the annual HULA general meeting including new board elections.  HULA would like to thank departing HULA board members Laura Gilda, Jess Kaneshiro, Kim Weersing, and Frances Ajo for their years of service to the HULA community, welcome new board members Buffy Cushman-Patz, Steve Fleischer, Chris Stevens, and Bill Voss, as well as welcome back Raymond (Mondo) Chun and Jena Kline who were re-elected to the board.

PS, the summer league received a weak response and was cancelled.  Thank you all for taking the survey, we're sorry it didn't happen.
