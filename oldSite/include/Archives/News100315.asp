For all interested in watching some great ultimate (of course I hope those involved show up too), Hawaii sectionals is kickin' off this Sunday 9/27/09 (note there was a mistake in the first Hulamail notification, it is SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY) starting at 10am pitting Party Van vs. Handi Van vs. Shuggah.  Note that Hawaii has two bids open for Southwest Regionals this year!  Good luck to all the teams, and if you'd like to come out and support our local club teams, come out to <a href="http://www.hawaiiultimate.com/wiki/index.php?title=MakikiDistrictPark" target="blank">Makiki Park</a> on Sunday 9/27/09 at 10am.

A high priority right now is to get yo'self <a href="http://www.hawaiiultimate.com/wiki/index.php?title=Fall2009" target="blank">registered for Fall League 2009</a>.  Commissioners Chris Cook and Jack Wade promise to step it up this year and introduce some new, fun and spirited ideas to the community.  Please note that league this season is primarily going to be held at <a href="http://www.hawaiiultimate.com/wiki/index.php?title=KokoHead" target="blank">Koko Head District Park</a> in Hawaii Kai.
