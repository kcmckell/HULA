Whaddup HULA!<BR>
Been a while, once again, and many apologies (but you should be used to that by now).  Lot's been happening in the ultimate world here in beautiful Hawai`i and long overdue for an update.  Summer has passed, Tweedle Beetle, Loco Moco, and UPA (oops, i mean USAU) Sectionals and Regionals have been completed (congratulations to local teams Party Van and Shugga representing Hawai`i for the Southwest Region) and that means it is TIME FOR MORE ULTIMATE.  I bet you thought we were going to take a rest...hell no.  Not in these islands.<BR>

FIRST up, <a href="wiki/index.php?title=Leagues" target="blank">HULA Fall League 2010</a> is revving up, beginning with a first ever official League Beach Hat Draw this Saturday October 16, 2010 (see website for details).  The brainchild of our very own Chris Stevens, we've been noticing a HUGE crowd of new faces on the pickup fields lately and we'd like to get to know you!  Also, we'd like the Fall League Captains to be able to get to know you so we can draft you accordingly :)  It'll be a fun day of beach ultimate, grillin', leisure games and good clean (okay maybe not all clean) fun.  New players to ultimate or old ultimate players new to Hawai`i, come on out and meet us, show us whatcha got.  Also, GO GIT REGISTERED!  The draft is coming soon!!! (Late registrants can always email the commissioners)<BR>

On a related note, with the beginning of Fall League 2010, Vu Le will be reprising his roll as the Rec Night Ranger every Thursday night at Kapaolono Field.  <a href="wiki/index.php?title=RecNight">Rec Night</a> is geared towards offering a comfortable environment for new ultimate players to hone their skills in a less-competitive environment.  Vu will lead a warmup, some drills and a scrimmage that will eventually lead into open pickup later in the evening.  Individuals or teams may occasionally volunteer to run special clincs as well.  Thanks for heading it up, Vu!<BR>

Next, in LESS THAN A MONTH (when did that happen?), <a href="hopu" target="blank">Yo Ho Hopu Ka Lewa</a>, savvy?  Sail t'the enchanted lands o'Waimanalo 'n bathe in the warm rays o'sunshine we've ordered specially fer yer enjoyment.  Drink up me hearties and climb aboard our ship, perchance to boatrace or perchance just to leisurely enjoy our finest grog.  We've a record crew'o players this year, 18 boats in all methinks.  Miss it and ye be sent t'the depths o'Davy Jones' Locker.  ARRRGGGGHHH!!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Ahem (*Patooie!*).  And last but not least, we've got <a href="kk/kk24">Kaimana Klassik 24</a> looming in the very near distance.  In fact, bids are ALREADY DUE IN NOVEMBER.  Get your teams organized and get ready to play some solid Women's or Open Ultimate.  Ranked the best tournament EVER by the UPA (okay I made that up, but the UPA don't exist anymore so...meh), Kaimana Klassik 24 is gaurenteed (or your beverages are free) to blow your socks off.
