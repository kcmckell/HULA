Aloha HULA and guests, thanks for stopping by and apologies for the long lagging updates.
<BR><BR>
Our tournament season (Hopu in November and Kaimana in February) has come and gone with some wonderful ultimate, parties and both new and old friendships flourishing.
<BR><BR>
On our plate now we have <a href="http://www.hawaiiultimate.com/wiki/index.php?title=Leagues" target="blank">Spring League 2010</a> underway.  Although teams have already been chosen, sign up, contact the league commissioners and just show up on Friday night to be placed on a team.
<BR><BR>
The <a href="http://www.hawaiiultimate.com/wiki/index.php?title=Pickup" target="blank">Pickup</a> schedule has been revised following some confusion that HULA apologizes for.  Come out and play!
<BR><BR>
Look out for some possible summertime ultimate fun like Bok Choy and/or Loco Moco if they happen.  Get on our email lists (below) for the most up-to-date information or feel free to contact us.
