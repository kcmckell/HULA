Haha, horrible webmastering. Who hired this guy?

With the closing of Tweedle, Hopu, and Fall League, would you believe there's still ultimate going on? Of course there is, this is Hawai`i. Even if it's raining, it's a warm rain!
<BR> MOST IMPORTANT right now, however, is <a href="http://www.http://hawaiiultimate.com/kk/kk25/" target="blank">Kaimana Klassik 25</a>! Woohoo! Feb. 18-20, 2012, Kaimana is an open/women's tournament running 3 days over a long weekend. I believe we have 16/16 teams too...HUGE. Local teams have begun practices, sign up for the kane (men) or wahine (women) googlegroups below. I dont' believe any of the 4 O`ahu teams are full yet!
<BR><BR>
At some point Spring League will also get started up, likely after Kaimana but possibly before, stay tuned!
