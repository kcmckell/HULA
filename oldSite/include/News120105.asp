Whoa, quick update this time! Sort of.
<BR>
SO MUCH ULTIMATE HAPPENING. We've got the Tweedle Beetle Beach Battle (Aug.), LocoMoco (Sept.), and last but not least, Huli Huli Hopu Ka Lewa 13 (Nov.)!!! And somewhere in the midst of all of that, O`ahu Fall League will begin. I hear we might even have daytime games for part of it.
<BR><BR>
FIRST off. The epic <a href="http://hawaiiultimate.com/wiki/index.php?title=TournamentTweedleBeetle" target="blank">Tweedle Beetle Beach Battle</a> is a GO baby. Tweedle is a hat draw beach tournament. 5 on 5 on the field, which includes non-existent sideline on the makai (ocean) side. Yes...includes...non-existent. Deal. It's cheap (low as $5, probably $10 'cause you're lazy), it's fun (likely naked fun), and it's just good for the soul. Check it out, August 27-28, 2011. No need register, just COME ON OUT!

And finally, last but surely not least <a href="http://hawaiiultimate.com/hopu/" target="blank">Huli Huli Hopu Ka Lewa 13</a> at the Waimanalo Polo fields November 11-14, 2011. Bids have been accepted and INDIVIDUAL REGISTRATION IS OPEN! 16 badass teams will face off for glory; both in the field, at the keg, under the tent, in someone else's tent, under the stage, under the stars, in a hammock, at the pirate's cove....yeah...both!
